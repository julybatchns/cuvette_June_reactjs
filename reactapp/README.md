## State Handling

## In React, a controlled component is a form element that is controlled by the state. The form elementâ€™s value is derived from the state, and any changes made to it trigger an event that updates the state.

# A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a pattern in React that allows you to reuse component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or functionality.

# The useReducer hook is a great alternative to useState for managing complex state logic in React components. It is particularly useful when dealing with state that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

# React's useContext is a hook that allows you to access the context values in functional components.
