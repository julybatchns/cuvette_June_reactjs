## State Handling

## In React, a controlled component is a form element that is controlled by the state. The form element’s value is derived from the state, and any changes made to it trigger an event that updates the state.

# A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a pattern in React that allows you to reuse component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or functionality.

# The useReducer hook is a great alternative to useState for managing complex state logic in React components. It is particularly useful when dealing with state that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

# React's useContext is a hook that allows you to access the context values in functional components.

Consumer => Provider => Store

# The useRef Hook in React is used to hold a mutable value that doesn't cause a re-render when updated. It is commonly used for accessing DOM elements or storing vaalues tht persist across renders without causing a component to re-render.

# React will not re-render a component when a ref's value changes because refs are not considered part of the component’s state. They are simply a way to persist values across renders, without affecting the component’s lifecycle.
