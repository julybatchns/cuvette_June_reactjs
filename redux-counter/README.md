# Redux is a popular state management library used with JavaScript applications, particularly with React.js. It helps manage the application's state in a predictable way. In Redux, the state of your app is stored in a single source of truth (a store), and the only way to change the state is by dispatching actions, which are processed by reducers.

#1. Store: Holds the state of your entire application.
#2. Actions: Objects that tell the reducer how to change the state.
#3. Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action and return the new state.
#4. Dispatch: A function used to send an action to the store.
